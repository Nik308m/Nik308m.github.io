        /* In Java, the join() method is used in multithreading to ensure that a thread
        completes its execution before the calling thread proceeds further.
        It essentially waits for the thread to finish. This is particularly useful when you
        need to coordinate the execution of multiple threads, ensuring certain
        threads finish before others start or continue. */
